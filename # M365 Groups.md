# Lifecycles are important

Think of anything in nature or a project it eventually passes on or becomes unused, this is normal and a general idea is that most of these groups will probably only last 6-12 months.

## M365 Groups

Review the [Key Governance Capabilities and licensing requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-overview?view=o365-worldwide#key-governance-capabilities-and-licensing-requirements)

* Setup Group Expiration Policy
* Setup Group Naming Policy
  * Reserved words in group names
  * Monitored Keywords
* Use Classification labels / Sensitivity Labels
* Define collaboration with external guests
* Manage group creation permissions

Consider enforcing a office 365 group to make sure all the services are provisioned , and that the group don't need to be adjusted to include additional resources such as planner.

Here is a customer example [Finding your collaboration sweet spot with Office 365 Groups SharePoint Teams and | BRK2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx9eVwqXeQk).
