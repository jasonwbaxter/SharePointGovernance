# Governance Quick Start

I've been reviewing several whitepapers and i'm trying to make this a bit simpler, This is a very broad topic and unique to every organisation & its culture. Our [Governance Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/governance-overview)

## Lifecycles are important

Think of anything in nature or a project it eventually passes on or becomes unused, this is normal and a general idea is that if there is data coming in , it also needs to go out.  

There are two main paths here:

* [What is collaboration governance ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-overview?view=o365-worldwide)
* [Planning intranet governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/intranet-governance)

## The beginning of my summary starting with M365 Groups

Review the [Key Governance Capabilities and licensing requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaboration-governance-overview?view=o365-worldwide#key-governance-capabilities-and-licensing-requirements)

* Setup Group Expiration Policy
* Setup Group Naming Policy
  * Reserved words in group names
  * Monitored Keywords
* Use Classification labels / Sensitivity Labels
* Define collaboration with external guests
* Manage group creation permissions

Consider enforcing a office 365 group to make sure all the services are provisioned , and that the group don't need to be adjusted to include additional resources such as planner.

Here is a customer story on their governance / implementation [Finding your collaboration sweet spot with Office 365 Groups SharePoint Teams and | BRK2210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx9eVwqXeQk).

## SharePoint Online

* Setup a training portal (M365 Learning Pathways)
* Deploy the SharePoint Success Site for site owners (more on this later.)
* Let users create sites from the SharePoint start page and OneDrive or point them to your provisioning process, if you don't have one consider Request a team Teams app template.
* You can encourage following design guidelines by using [Site designs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apply-and-customize-sharepoint-site-templates-39382463-0e45-4d1b-be27-0e96aeec8398?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).
* Consider leaving SharePoint site sharing settings as default , or restricted if you cannot classify data yet.
* Allow only users in specific security groups to share externally
* Manage domain allow/block lists for Azure AD and SharePoint together. Create an org-wide governance process for allowing and blocking domains.
* External sharing for organization and site

## Intranet Governance aspects

* Vision
* Policies and guidelines
* Site provisioning and decommissioning
* Information architecture and search
* Branding
* Content management
* Security and information management
* Roles and responsibilities
* Feedback
* Training and support
* Measurement

Consider publishing this sort of information on the SharePoint Success site, you can provision survey's , usage guidelines , success stories etc.
Record some basic video demos or a flow chart displaying decision making processes to avoid having to consult so much.
